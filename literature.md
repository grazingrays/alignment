- use of photodiode to measure cut-off beam
- check horizontal position during measurements (how often?)
- monitor specular reflection position 

Quote: 
> Care has to be taken that the sample height is properly aligned to the half-beam position at all times, as small devia- tions can change the sample–detector distance by several millimetres. During the measurements, this can be checked with a photodiode at the direct beam position behind the sample, which should show half the signal of the full beam diode current at an incidence angle of 0°. Additionally, the position of the specularly reflected beam on the detector should be monitored during the measurements.
